## How to contribute

First you have to follow [Installation Guide](##Installation-(for-Developers)) to build the project.

We references all in-progress or future developpements on cards in [Github Project](https://github.com/echopen/PRJ-medtec_androidapp/projects/1).

You can **pick one card** you are interested to work on and you can also contact [authors](###Authors) to discuss best way to contribute on a task. 
You can also report a bug or ask for new features on [Github issues](https://github.com/echopen/android-app/issues)

We follow the described integration process:

* fork the project on your local profile
* implement the new feature
* create a pull requests on *echopen/master* branch
* pull request is reviewed by contributors
* commit is integrated to echOpen project !

## Installation (for Developers)

### Setup environment
In order to ease the developement and to prevent the contributor from the hassle of spending days configuring. We set up a [Virtual Machine](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0V8htWBLPWBVEh6ZEJPcFpmTEU), with all the tools needed. You can find all the informations [here](https://echopen.gitbooks.io/android-app/content/echopens_virtual_machine.html).

You can also configure manually your development environement. 

As an android app, you need to install the following dependencies:

* [java JDK](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/).
* [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) as builder tools.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) as development IDE.
* **Android SDK** and tools installed via Android Studio

### Setup echOpen mobile application
First you need to clone echOpen android mobile application project.

Before being able to build the app, you have to configure your local android project settings, in *local.properties* file: 
```
	sdk.dir=/Path/To/Your/.../Android/sdk
	ndk.dir=/Path/To/Your/.../android-ndk-r10e
```
Then you can build the project via **Android Studio**, or
you can build the project by executing the Gradle wrapper from the project directory, example:

Mac/Linux
```
	./gradlew assembleDebug
```
Windows
```
	gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```


To debug the mobile application on a device:

* Switch the Android device to dev mode (generally, tap 7 times on "Version number" in parameters)
* Enable USB debugging
* Connect the device to your computer (with screen unlocked to see the prompt)
* Accept the prompt on your device, to authorize your computer
* Launch gradlew with `installDebug`

### Probe emulator

The probe emulator is used to mimic message exchanges between the real probe and the mobile application.
In order to use it in your project you have to consider the following steps:

  * Go to the folder dedicated to probe emulator
```bash
cd ~/PRJ-medtech-androidapp/probe_emulator
 ```

  * compile the **probe emulator binary** using the laptop configuration

```bash
	 ./run.sh -m PC
```
  * Normally the binary *probe_emulator* has been created in *PRJ-medtech-androidapp* folder and now you can run it with different options described below:
	  * *void* option will send on a loop an image fill with only value 8192
	  * *plate* option will send on a loop an image of a plate
	  * *hand* option will send on a loop an image of the cross-section of a hand
	  * *film* will send on a loop an echographic film of the   cross-sections of a hand an harm

```bash
  ./probe_emulator film
```

The terminal shoud display the following feedback message *film* when probe emulator succeed to start.

  * configure the mobile application to connect to the probe on the same network.

```java
package com.echopen.asso.echopen.utils;

public class Constants{
	...
  public static final String REDPITAYA_IP = "your ip adress";
	...
}
```
* recompile the application for your mobile phone

* connect your mobile phone on the same Wifi network as your laptop

* run *echOpen* mobile application on your phone

You should normally receive the images from the probe


## Documentation

You can get high-level documentation on our [GitBook](https://echopen.gitbooks.io/android-app/content/) mobile application section.

You have also access to a detailed documentation in the *projectRootDirectory/doc* folder and to a [doxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen) documentation in *projectRootDirectory/doc/javadoc_app*

## Challenges and To Dos
